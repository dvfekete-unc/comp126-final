            <!-- Biography -->
            <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
                <p>Carl Hart had a difficult early life. He grew up in an impoverished neighborhood in Miami, and after his mother left his father, he and his siblings lived with various relatives nearby. He was a star athlete in high school and was regularly around drugs and violence during this time. Following high school, he enrolled in the United States Air Force and took the college classes provided to him. He graduated from University of Maryland with a Bachelor’s degree in Science.</p>
                <p>Following his undergraduate years, he worked at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington before attending the 
                University of Wyoming to earn his Ph.D. in Neuroscience. At this point, he had dedicated his career to studying the 
                underlying causes of addiction and drug abuse that had been so prevalent in his teenage years. Hart eventually married 
                a woman, Robin, and the two settled down in New York City with their three kids. Hart now heads the department of 
                Psychology at Columbia University and continues his research with addiction and drug abuse.</p>
            
            <!-- Research -->
            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Carl Hart recognized the signs of addiction and drug abuse early on in his life. He dedicated his career to understanding the neural mechanisms that cause addiction. Carl Hart is well-known as an advocate for decriminalization for all drugs based upon the notions that our current drug policies are created from limited viewpoints and/or inappropriate assumptions.</p>
                <p>His research is focused on understanding factors and circumstances that lead to decisions about whether or not to self-administer drugs (Hart, 2016). He gave a TEDMED presentation on the stigma surrounding drug users and various treatments to overcome addiction. He focuses on psychoactive drugs and their efficacy in response to drug-addicted individuals, and the connection these make with the neurochemical grounds for this behavior (Dr. Carl Hart, 2019).</p>
                <p>He is currently the chair of the Department of Psychology at Columbia University, and is the first African-American professor of sciences at Columbia University to obtain tenure.</p>
        
            <!-- Course Connection -->
            <h2>Course Connection</h2>
                <p>Carl Hart’s research is extremely pertinent to many facets of this course, particularly the units that covered reward, motivation, and drug addiction. His research focuses on the social and environmental factors that lead to drug addiction. These directly correlate to our class discussions on the mesolimbic pathway and how addiction stems from the stimulation of this pathway. We discussed how various drugs influence this differently to induce pleasure, increase dopamine release, and activate the reward pathway.</p>
                <p>Carl Hart works tirelessly to combat the stigma against drug users and research new treatment to help addicted users. In our course, we learned about various treatments that ease withdrawal symptoms and how these medications are best combined with behavioral and social counseling.</p>
