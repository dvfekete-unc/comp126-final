            <!-- Research -->
            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Her specificalized area is psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Her interested areas are chronic pain, severe, and persistent mental illness with emphasis on pain response. In one of her recent published research work, Kapoor and her team investigated the interactive effect of the serotonin transporter genotype and drug use on suicidal behaviors in patients with bipolar disorder, abbreviated as BD (Baylor College, n.d.). The results were: 1) Based on drug use, the short and long allele had different effects. 2) for BD patients with little to no drug use, the short allele was the risk of suicidal behavior. 3) for BD patients with a higher amount of drug use, the long allele was the risk for suicidal behavior (Roane et al., 2019).</p>
        
            <!-- Course Connection -->
            <h2>Course Connection</h2>
                <p>In NSCI 175, we talked about mental illness, specifically we talked about the affective disorders (depression and bipolar disorder). Kapoorâ€™s recent work was emphasized on patients who were diagnosed with bipolar disorders. Her work also contained information that we learned about the serotonin transporters. While we did not talk in-depth about the serotonin transporters, however, we learned what serotonin is and its effect on our brains.</p>
