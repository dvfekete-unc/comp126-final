            <!-- Biography -->
            <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
                <p>Brown was born in Ocala, Florida to parents Benjamin Brown and Alberta Brown. His parents were both high school teachers which allowed him to grow up in an environment surrounded by math and science. Though no one in his family was a doctor, he knew it was something he wanted to do from as young as age seven. Brown attended Fessenden Elementary and Middle Schools, Osceola Junior High School and North Marion High School. Brown graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1974 in which he spent the second semester of his senior year in the School Year Abroad Program in Spain. While abroad for that semester he studied Spanish. In 1978 he got his B.A. in applied mathematics from Harvard College. After graduation he received an International Rotary Foundation Fellowship to study mathematics at the Institut Fourier des Mathématiques Pures in France. After this he entered the Harvard Medical School M.D. Ph.D. program and received his M.A in 1984 in statistics and his Ph.D. in statistics in 1988 from Harvard University and his M.D. in 1987 from Harvard Medical School. Brown then did his internship in internal medicine and a research fellowship in endocrinology at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. He then completed his residency in anesthesiology at WGH and joined there in the Department of Anesthesia and joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School as well as MIT. Currently Brown holds many titles as he is the Warren M. Zapol Professor of Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School, the Edward Hood Taplid Professor of Medical Engineering at M.I.T’s institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and a Professor of computational neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Brown has made an impressive career for himself publishing widely on topics of anesthesiology, neural signal processing, and computational neuroscience. He has received many awards for his work and he is most notably the first African American, first statistician, and first anesthesiologist that was elected to not one but all three branches of the National Academy (engineering, science, and medicine). He is the principal investigator of the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory at MGH and MIT where he currently spends much of his time doing research however there is no mention of a further personal life or family connections.</p>
            
            <!-- Research -->
            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Brown’s research has been categorized by his work in anesthesia and neural signal processing. His work in neural signal processing algorithms has led to understanding how hippocampal neurons represent spatial information, analyzing these formations during learning, and relate the changes in hippocampal neural activity to the changes in performance (Emery N. Brown, n.d.) . Brown has also made the contributions of improving signal extraction from FMRI images, localizing neural activity from EEG and MEG recordings, measuring circadian pacemakers periods and sensitivity to light, characterizing the spiking properties of neurons in the primary motor cortex, and more (Emery N. Brown). His work in general anesthesia is just as extensive and informative. He is currently studying how the state of general anesthesia is both induced and maintained (Emery N. Brown, n.d.). His goal in this objective is to create a better definition of anesthesia, improve its safety, and improve the methods of measuring anesthesia. He has worked and published on a vast array of topics, these just his most notable, and continues to work today as the head of many departments and doing his own work and research in the field of neuroscience.</p>
        
            <!-- Course Connection -->
            <h2>Course Connection</h2>
                <p>Brown’s both current and past work correlates to many topics and learning objectives of our class. His use of FMRI and otherimaging systems to facilitate his understanding of neural activity and anesthesia ties into the unit structures of the nervous system 1 where we learned about these methods. They play an integral part in our studies of almost every disorder and every unit as we use their methods to compare topics and understand the brain. Brown’s immense contribution to the knowledge of the hippocampus connects to many units but most recently our units on mental illness and memory as the hippocampus relates to the HPA-axis, is part of the limbic system, and has vast implications in memory formation. One the most interesting connections to the class is the specific way Brown characterized the properties of the human circadian system. In the early part of his career he applied his methods to answering many fundamental questions about circadian physiology that we now study and learned about in the brain rhythms and sleep unit. All of his work enhanced the way we now study neuroscience in this course and courses like it. Even Brown’s current research can be correlated to our learning as we in class are always looking to solve the many whys and unknowns of neuroscience today. Brown is at the forefront of research finding us those answers that we will soon be hearing about and studying as well.</p>
